# Art Blocks Engine (React Template)
[![GitPOAPs](https://public-api.gitpoap.io/v1/repo/ArtBlocks/artblocks-engine-react/badge)](https://www.gitpoap.io/gh/ArtBlocks/artblocks-engine-react)

This project is meant to be used as a template to build Art Blocks Engine web apps. It contains all of the pages and views necessary for users to browse projects, tokens and be able to purchase mints. This repository serves as a prototype or template. 

It assumes your core contract is `GenArt721CoreV3` and your minting contract is `MinterDAExpV4` with all sales priced in ETH. 

It is NOT intended for production use as-is. Please modify for your needs and test extensively before using.

# Quick Start

Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependencies.

To run the project locally you will need to create a `.env` configuration file. You can get started by copying `sample.env` and renaming it as `.env`. 

**Important note:** if you are planning to run/host this template via Vercel, you will populate these environment variables in the Vercel "Environment Variables" settings rather than defining them in your local `.env` file.

Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to run the project locally.

After making any changes to the `.env` file, you will need to restart the app.

The default values specified in the provided `sample.env` file are reflected in the demo hosting found at: https://artblocks-engine-react.vercel.app/

## Customizing your configuration

In order to customize your specific implementation, you will need to edit the default configuration provided on the `sample.env` file. First of all, you will need to replace the contract addresses with your own.

You must specify an API key from [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) as well as a chain id in your environment file. Use `1` for mainnet or `5` for goerli. Alternative providers can be used by modifying the `src/components/Providers.tsx` file. Use multiple `.env` fiels to set up `development` or `staging` environments on `testnet` if you wish to do so.

There are additional configuration values you could customize like the number of projects per page, or tokens per page. You will find those parameters in `src/config.ts`.
